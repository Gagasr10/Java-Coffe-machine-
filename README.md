We have created a program for a coffee machine.

The machine has several drinks:

Short expresso
Extended ekrpeso
Cappuccino

The device has a container for water, a container for coffee, and a container for milk.

When preparing the drink, the machine uses water, coffee and sometimes milk, depending on the choice of coffee.

For every preparation of the drink, the device throws out a message telling what it is currently doing.

If there is no more water, the device should display the message: "Out of watter".
If there is no coffee: "Machine is out of coffee".
When there is no milk: "Machine is out of milk".

During each preparation of the drink, the device must display a message about what it is currently doing, e.g. pourWater, pourMilk.

For each ordered drink, the device deducts the value from the total inserted credit, if there is no credit, the device must output the message: "Not enough credit".
